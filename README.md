# Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Encoder

Welcome to the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Encoder project! This repository provides an implementation and explanation of how the encoder component of a VAE works.

## Overview

A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a generative model that combines ideas from autoencoders and probabilistic latent variable models. The encoder is a crucial part of the VAE architecture, responsible for mapping input data into a latent space that captures meaningful features of the data distribution.

## How the VAE Encoder Works

The VAE encoder performs the following steps:

1. **Input Data**: Receive input data (e.g., images, sequences) that you want to encode into a latent representation.

2. **Encoding**: Pass the input data through several layers of neural networks. These layers reduce the input data's dimensionality and gradually transform it into a lower-dimensional latent space. The final layer of the encoder produces two vectors: mean (`μ`) and log variance (`log(σ^2)`).

3. **Latent Space Sampling**: Use the mean and log variance vectors to sample a point (`z`) from the latent space. This step introduces a stochastic element that makes the VAE a generative model. The sampled point represents the encoded latent representation of the input data.

4. **Reparameterization Trick**: The reparameterization trick is employed to enable backpropagation through the sampling process. Instead of directly sampling from the learned distribution, you sample from a standard normal distribution (`ε ~ N(0, 1)`) and then transform it using `z = μ + ε * σ`.

5. **Latent Representation**: The sampled point `z` becomes the compact and continuous latent representation of the input data. This representation captures the essential features of the input in a lower-dimensional space.
